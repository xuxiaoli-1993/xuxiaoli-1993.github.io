         <p style="font-size:18pt">In metal additive manufacturing (MAM), the metal (typically in powder form) is
         repeated melted by an energy source (e.g., laser) and solidified (when disengaged from the
         laser) to become the 3-dimensional build.
         My research is to simulate the physical phenomena in this process with computational
         techniques. The simualtion, by "reproducing" the physical phenomena, can contribute to the
         maturation of MAM in two ways:
         (1) the underlying science can be quantitatively understood, which informs better process
         design. (2) the simulation can partially replace the trial-and-error tests to expedite the
         optimization of process parameters. </p>

         <h3>Background</h3>
         <h4>1. Process Physics</h4>
         <p>Metal Additive Manufacturing (MAM) is an emerging manufacturing technique which has the
         potentail to revolutionalize the manufaturing industry credited to its capabilities of
         producing parts with flexbile geometries. Typically, an energy source (laser, electron beam, etc.) melts metal powders to form a molten pool. When the
         laser is disengaged from the metal, the molten pool cools down to form the solid part.
         This process can be repeated layer-by-layer, and only the powders undergoing the
         melting-solification process will contribute to the bulk part. Therefore, the build
         geometry can be easily manipulated by controlling the interaction between the laser and the
         powders.</p>

         <p>Despite the straightforward concept of MAM, the underlying physics in a typical MAM
         process is not fully understood. Recently, in-situ observations have revealed the complexity
         of the multi-physcis phenomena.</p>

         <p>Let's first consider the interaction of laser and a bare metal plate (no powder
         involved). This "simpler" setup resembles that of a laser welding process. The in-situ
         high-speed X-ray imaging technique reveals more details on the multiphysics phenemena,
         specificaly, the metal vaporization and the formation of keyhole.</p>

               made of Ti-6Al-4V. The depression zone is referred to as the "Keyhole" where the
               local metal vaporization exerts a recoil pressure on the molten pool. Interestingly,
               the keyhole is subject to a seemingly periodic oscillation. At this point of time,
               this phenomenon has not been fully understood. Source of the video:

         </figure>

         <p>When a layer of powder is deposited on the metal substrate, the laser-metal interaction
         is further complicated. The metal vaporization form a vapor jet which then entrains the
         surrounding powders towards the laser-illuminated region. This is known as a classic fluid
         mechanics phenomenon referred to as the "entrainment". Once entrained, the powders have the
         chance of being incorporated into the molten pool or ejected away by the vapor jet.</p>

            <figcaption style="font-size:14pt">High-speed X-ray video for a stationary laser illuminating on a
               pre-deposited powder bed. As we can see the powder-gas interaction is dynamic and difficult to quantify by
               experiments. Fortunately, multiphysics simulation is ready tool to complement with
               experiments to deepen our understandings regarding these complex physics. Source of the video:

         <p>Moving on to the case where the laser can be moved relative to the metal. The laser
         heating still triggers the metal vaporization and the formation of keyhole. However, the
         keyhole dynamics is more complicated than the stationary laser cases. The "front keyhole
         wall" refers to the inclined keyhole surface which is relatively stable. The "rear keyhole
         wall" is the keyhole surface that is dynamically oscillating, displaying drastically different dynamics than the
         front keyhole wall. At this point of time, this dynamic behavior is not fully understood,
         but is crutial to the development of powder bed fusion process.</p>

               dynamics with or without powder seem to be similar. One interesting question is how
               the powder can (or may not) affect the dynamics of the molten pool/keyhole. Source of the video:

         <p>The process physics of MAM is an active ongoing research area.
         The state-of-the-art experimental and mutliphysics simulation techniques keep revealing
         these physical phenomena at both finer spatial and temporal scale. The
         development and certification of MAM will be highly dependent on these scientific findings.</p>

         <h4>2. Structural Features (Grain Structure)</h4>
         <p>Due to the unique process physics, the thermal history that the metal material
         experiences in MAM is also unique. This thermal history then determines the distinctive microstructure
         of the metal upon its solidification. Specifically, "exotic" grain structures have been
         identified for a variety of alloy materials. E.g., alluminum based (Al-10Si-Mg), iron based
         (stainless steel AISI 316), and titanium based (Ti-6Al-4V) alloys. The uniqueness of the
         thermal history of MAM lies in that the solidification rate is extremly fast and
         directional. Since the laser only heats a specific location for a short period of time (~
         tens of micronseconds), the metal material experiences a surge of temperature (melting and
         vaporization) followed by a rapid solidification which follows the direction of the laser.
         Indeed, it is the fast and directional solidification that causes the unique grain
         structures in MAM.</p>

         <h3>Powder Bed Generation and Ray Tracing</h3>
         <p>This project is aimed to set the foundations for the subsequent multiphyscis simulations
         for MAM processes. In this project, a powder bed generation model is used to create the
         structure of a powder bed as in LPBF processes. Then the initial laser-metal interaction,
         i.e., right when the laser is turned on, is simulated using the ray-tracing algorithm. The
         laser absorption distribution on the powder surfaces is computed, which will trigger
         the melting and vaporization of the metal.</p>

         <p>A randomly packed powder bed is generated by a
         "rain-dropping" algorithm (<a
                  href=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/003754977903200102
                  target="_blank" class="mylink">Jodrey, W., et al. Simulation (1979)</a>). The powder bed is then represented by the level-set 
         function. Based on the level-set field, the ray-tracing algorithm is implemented to track
         the mutliple reflections of laser beam on powder surfaces, which eventually provides the
         absorption distribution.</p>
