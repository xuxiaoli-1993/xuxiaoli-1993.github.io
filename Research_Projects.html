         <h2>Powder Bed Generation and Ray Tracing</h2>
         <hr color="red" size="2">
         <p>This project is aimed to simulate the laser absorption distribution among a powder bed, as typically in
         a laser powder bed fusion process. A randomly packed powder bed is generated by the PACKS algorithm (stands 
        for Probabilistic-Analytic Consecutive Kinetic Simulation). The powder bed is then represented by the level-set 
       function. The ray-tracing algorithm is implemented to calculate the absorbed distribution.</p>

            <figcaption>Typical powder bed generated with the PACKS algorithm. The powder size is Gaussian distributed, with 
            a magnitude of tens of micrmeters, as in typical laser powder bed fusion processes. The powder bed thickness is
            about 100 &mu;m.</figcaption>

            the large powders has a size of 15-45 &mu;m and the small powders have a size of 9-11 &mu;m.</figcaption>

            <figcaption>Ray-tracing algorithm demonstration. (a): A powder bed. (b): ray bundles are shot from top and each ray
               is traced for its multiple reflection on powder surfaces. (c): Collect the absorbed energy from each ray and the
               absorption distribution on the powder surface can be obtained.
