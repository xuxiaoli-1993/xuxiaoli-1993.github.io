      <h2 class="myh2" style="text-align:center">Research Statement</h2>
      <p style="font-size:14pt">In metal additive manufacturing (MAM), the metal (typically in powder form) is
      repeated melted by an energy source (e.g., laser) and solidified (when disengaged from the
      laser) to become the 3-dimensional build.
      My research is to simulate the physical phenomena in this process with computational
      techniques. The simualtion, by "reproduce" the physical phenomena, can contribute to the
      maturation of MAM in two ways:
      (1) the underlying science can be quantitatively understood, which informs better process
      design. (2) the simulation can partially replace the trial-and-error tests to expediate the
      optimization of process parameters. </p>

         <h3>Powder Bed Generation and Ray Tracing</h3>
         <p>This project is aimed to simulate the laser absorption distribution among a powder bed, as typically in
         a laser powder bed fusion process. A randomly packed powder bed is generated by the PACKS algorithm (stands 
        for Probabilistic-Analytic Consecutive Kinetic Simulation). The powder bed is then represented by the level-set 
       function. The ray-tracing algorithm is implemented to calculate the absorbed distribution.</p>

            <figcaption>Typical powder bed generated with the PACKS algorithm. The powder size is Gaussian distributed, with 
            a magnitude of tens of micrmeters, as in typical laser powder bed fusion processes. The powder bed thickness is
            about 100 &mu;m.</figcaption>

            the large powders has a size of 15-45 &mu;m and the small powders have a size of 9-11 &mu;m.</figcaption>

            <figcaption>Ray-tracing algorithm demonstration. (a): A powder bed. (b): ray bundles are shot from top and each ray
               is traced for its multiple reflection on powder surfaces. (c): Collect the absorbed energy from each ray and the
               absorption distribution on the powder surface can be obtained.
