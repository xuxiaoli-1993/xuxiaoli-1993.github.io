         <p style="font-size:14pt">In metal additive manufacturing (MAM), the metal (typically in powder form) is
         repeated melted by an energy source (e.g., laser) and solidified (when disengaged from the
         laser) to become the 3-dimensional build.
         My research is to simulate the physical phenomena in this process with computational
         techniques. The simualtion, by "reproducing" the physical phenomena, can contribute to the
         maturation of MAM in two ways:
         (1) the underlying science can be quantitatively understood, which informs better process
         design. (2) the simulation can partially replace the trial-and-error tests to expedite the
         optimization of process parameters. </p>

         <h3>Background</h3>
         <p>Metal Additive Manufacturing (MAM) is an emerging manufacturing technique which has the
         potentail to revolutionalize the manufaturing industry credited to its capabilities of
         producing parts with flexbile geometries. Typically, an energy source (laser, electron beam, etc.) melts metal powders to form a molten pool. When the
         laser is disengaged from the metal, the molten pool cools down to form the solid part.
         This process can be repeated layer-by-layer, and only the powders undergoing the
         melting-solification process will contribute to the bulk part. Therefore, the build
         geometry can be easily manipulated by controlling the interaction between the laser and the
         powders.</p>

         <p>Despite the straightforward concept of MAM, the underlying physics in a typical MAM
         process is not fully understood. Recently, in-situ observations have revealed the complexity
         of the multi-physcis phenomena.</p>

         <p>Let's first consider the interaction of laser and a bare metal plate (no powder
         involved). This "simpler" setup resembles that of a laser welding process. The in-situ
         high-speed X-ray imaging technique reveals more details on the multiphysics phenemena,
         specificaly, the metal vaporization and the formation of keyhole.</p>

            <figcaption>High-speed X-ray video for a stationary laser illuminating on a bare plate
               made of Ti-6Al-4V. The depression zone is referred to as the "Keyhole" where the
               local metal vaporization exerts a recoil pressure on the molten pool. Interestingly,
               the keyhole is subject to a seemingly periodic oscillation. At this point of time,
               this phenomenon has not been fully understood. Source of the video:

         </figure>

         <p>When a layer of powder is deposited on the metal substrate, the laser-metal interaction
         is further complicated. The metal vaporization form a vapor jet which then entrains the
         surrounding powders towards the laser-illuminated region. This is known as a classic fluid
         mechanics phenomenon referred to as the "entrainment". Once entrained, the powders have the
         chance of being incorporated into the molten pool or ejected away by the vapor jet.</p>

               experiments. Fortunately, multiphysics simulation is ready tool to complement with
               experiments to deepen our understandings regarding these complex physics. Source of the video:

         <h3>Powder Bed Generation and Ray Tracing</h3>
         <p>This project is aimed to simulate the laser absorption distribution among a powder bed, as typically in
         a laser powder bed fusion process. A randomly packed powder bed is generated by a
         "rain-dropping" algorithm (<a
                  href=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/003754977903200102
                  target="_blank" class="mylink">Jodrey, W., et al. Simulation (1979)</a>). The powder bed is then represented by the level-set 
         function. The ray-tracing algorithm is implemented to calculate the absorbed distribution.</p>
