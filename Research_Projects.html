         <p style="font-size:14pt">In metal additive manufacturing (MAM), the metal (typically in powder form) is
         repeated melted by an energy source (e.g., laser) and solidified (when disengaged from the
         laser) to become the 3-dimensional build.
         My research is to simulate the physical phenomena in this process with computational
         techniques. The simualtion, by "reproduce" the physical phenomena, can contribute to the
         maturation of MAM in two ways:
         (1) the underlying science can be quantitatively understood, which informs better process
         design. (2) the simulation can partially replace the trial-and-error tests to expediate the
         optimization of process parameters. </p>

         <h3>Background</h3>
         <p>Metal Additive Manufacturing (MAM) is an emerging manufacturing technique which has the
         potentail to revolutionalize the manufaturing industry credited to its geometric
         flexiblity. Typically, an energy source (laser, electron beam, etc.) melts metal powders to form a molten pool. When the
         laser is disengaged from the powders, the molten pool cools down to form the solid part.
         This process can be repeated layer-by-layer, and only the powders undergoing the
         melting-solification process will contribute to the bulk part. Therefore, the build
         geometry can be easily manipulated by controlling the interaction between the laser and the
         powders.</p>

         <p>Despite the straightforward concept of MAM, the underlying physics in a typical MAM
         process is not fully understood. Recently, in-situ observations have revealed the complexity
         of the multi-physcis phenomena.</p>

         <h3>Powder Bed Generation and Ray Tracing</h3>
         <p>This project is aimed to simulate the laser absorption distribution among a powder bed, as typically in
         a laser powder bed fusion process. A randomly packed powder bed is generated by the PACKS algorithm (stands 
         for Probabilistic-Analytic Consecutive Kinetic Simulation). The powder bed is then represented by the level-set 
         function. The ray-tracing algorithm is implemented to calculate the absorbed distribution.</p>

               a magnitude of tens of micrmeters, as in typical laser powder bed fusion processes. The powder bed thickness is
               about 100 &mu;m.</figcaption>
