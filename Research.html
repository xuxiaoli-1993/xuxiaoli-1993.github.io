         <h3>Overview</h3>
         <p> 
         Metal Additive Manufacturing (MAM) is an emerging technology
         whose potential of achieving flexible geometry for metallic parts has revolutionizing
         impact on the manufacturing industry. Similar to many newly-developed manufacturing
         techniques, the maturation of MAM is hindered by two principal issues. First, the
         underlying science, especially during the building process of MAM, is not well understood,
         which brings the second issue, that the relationships between the Process, Structure,
         Property, and Performance (PSPP mapping) are not well understood. Not rarely, the success
         of a build relies on time-costly trial-and-error experiments that find the optimal
         selection of process parameters in large parameter space. Unfortunately, the optimal
         parameters cannot transfer among different materials and machines. The quality and
         consistency of MAM-built parts still need to be improved for demanding applications,
         e.g., aerospace and aeronautics.
         </p>

         <p>
         My research is to develop computational models to simulate the MAM process and the
         microstructure evolution in the MAM-built part. Quantitative information that is
         difficult to extract by experiments can be obtained by the models, e.g., the
         three-dimensional temperature, fluid flow, pressure, grain sizes, and texture. This
         quantitative information facilitates the understanding of the fundamental science in MAM
         and consequently advances the knowledge of PSPP mapping for MAM.
         </p>

         <p>
         Specifically, I develop a multi-physics process model to simulate as closely as possible the
         complex and intertwined physical phenomena in a MAM process. The temperature in the built
         part as a function of time and space is extracted from the process model, which is then fed
         into a structure model. The structure model simulates the grain nucleation and growth and
         predicts the grain size and morphology in the built part. These models are developed based
         on principles of fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, heat transfer, and some particular
         aspects of material science.

         <h3>Powder Bed Generation and Ray Tracing</h3>
         <p>
         This project is aimed to set the foundations for the subsequent multiphysics simulations
         for MAM processes. In this project, a powder bed generation model is used to create the
         structure of a powder bed as in LPBF processes. Then the initial laser-metal interaction is
         simulated using the ray-tracing algorithm. The laser absorption distribution on the powder
         surfaces is obtained from ray-tracing, which will trigger the melting and vaporization of
         the metal.
         </p>

         <p>
         A randomly packed powder bed is generated by a "rain-dropping" algorithm 
         (<a
             href=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/003754977903200102
             target="_blank" class="mylink">Jodrey, W., et al. Simulation (1979)</a>).
         The powder bed is then represented by the level-set function. Based on the level-set field,
         the ray-tracing algorithm is implemented to track the multiple reflections of laser beam on
         powder surfaces (governed by Fresnel equation), which eventually provides the absorption
         distribution.

               from top (red rays) and each ray is traced for its multiple reflection on powder
               surfaces. The tracing is stopped when the ray leaves the domain or its power is below
               1 %. (c): Collect the absorbed energy from each ray and the absorption distribution
               on the powder surface can be obtained.

               Comparison between grain structures simulated by the Cellular Automata (CA) model and
               those observed by the Electron Back-Scattered Diffraction (EBSD). All the cross
               sections are from the center plane of a thin-wall build. It is found that by
               increasing the nucleation rate in the CA simulations (from left to right), the grain
               structures are coarse columnar (left), fine needle-like columnar (middle), and
               "sandwich" in which layers of columnar and equiaxed grains coexist. These grain
               structures can also be commonly observed by the EBSD experiments. This result
               indicates that the nucleation condition in MAM processes can have significant
               influence on the build grain structure.
