\textbf{RESEARCH EXPERIENCE}

\fullrule
\textbf{Laser Absorption by Powder Bed} \hfill 2015 -- 2016
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, labelsep=5mm]
   \item Implemented a rain-dropping algorithm to generate randomly packed beds of powders as in
      typical laser powder bed fusion processes.
   \item Implemented the ray-tracing algorithm to model the multiple reflections of a laser beam on
      the surfaces of powders.
   \item Conducted parametric studies on the effects of powder size, powder bed thickness, and powder
      material on the laser absorption distribution within the powder bed.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{GEMS Maintenance} \hfill 2016 -- Now
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, labelsep=5mm]
   \item Maintaining a legacy code (in Fortran, over 25000 lines), General Equation Mesh Solver
      (GEMS), for solving fluid dynamics equations with unstructured mesh and MPI parallelization.
   \item Implemented the Level-Set and Ghost Fluid Method (over 10000 lines) into separate modules.
      Integrated the new modules into GEMS to enable multi-phase flow and fluid-solid interaction
      computations.
   \item Documented the methodology systematically. Designed and conducted benchmark CFD
      simulations for the verification of GEMS and new modules.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Cellular Automata Simulation for Grain Nucleation and Growth} \hfill 2016 -- 2018
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, labelsep=5mm]
   \item Developed a thermal model (based on GEMS) that simulates the heat transfer and
      temperature field in direct laser deposition processes.
   \item Implemented the Cellular Automata (CA) algorithm to simulate the grain nucleation and
      growth given the temperature field from the thermal model. Parallelized the CA algorithm with
      hybrid OpenMP and MPI.
   \item Conducted numerical experiments on the effects of nucleation conditions on the grain size,
      shape, and texture in the builds of direct laser deposition processes. Validated the simulation
      results with analytical models and EBSD experiments.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{3pt}

\textbf{Keyhole Dynamics in Laser Welding} \hfill 2018 -- Now
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, labelsep=5mm]
   \item Developed a multi-physics model (based on GEMS) that simulates the laser absorption, molten
      pool flow, evaporation/condensation kinetics, surface tension, and keyhole evolution in laser
      welding processes.
   \item Identified, extracted and analyzed principal quantities of interest from simulations.
   \item Synthesized results from simulations and X-ray imaging experiments (from collaborators) and
      provided explanations for the keyhole geometries and oscillations under varying processing
      conditions.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{3pt}

\textbf{Powder-gas Interaction in Laser Powder Bed Fusion} \hfill 2019 -- Now
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, labelsep=5mm]
   \item Implemented a Lagrangian-point forcing scheme and the Discrete Element Method to track
      particle motion driven by fluid-induced and collision forces. 
   \item Incorporate particle tracking with the laser welding model to simulate the powder
      motion in laser powder bed fusion processes.
   \item Identified characteristic modes of powder-gas interaction based on the quantification of
      the surrounding gas flow and gas-induced forces on powders.
\end{itemize}
